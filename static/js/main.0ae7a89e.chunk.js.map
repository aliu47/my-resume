This course was taught in JSP and I developed a simple commerce website where users are able to look a different products and add them to a cart.\r\n                        The backend to supply the products was a SQL database. Lastly a took course that covered the meteor framework and AWS. During this course I developed a crypto currency exchange website that allowed users to use\r\n                        fake money. The crypto prices were updated using the cryptocompare. The website featured several AWS features such as automated messaging and voice IO.

The company website was developed using AngularJS and PHP. During my time there\r\n                        I developed a login and registration system that has been a key component to sales and revenue. I also worked on various front-end designs including the sign in page\r\n                        and reworked the homepage.\r\n                         </div>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n                    <div className=\"flex items-center mb-1\">\r\n                        <div className=\"bg-gray-500 rounded-full h-8 w-8\"></div>\r\n                        <div className=\"flex-1 ml-4 font-medium\">August 2018 - Senior Year Fall Semester</div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"ml-12\">\r\n                        During this semester I began the 4+1 program at UNCC. This allowed me to take graduate courses during my senior year so I would only need 1 additional year to complete a master's.\r\n                        This semester I took 2 graduate courses and 1 undergraduate course. The undergraduate course was on Human computer interaction. This course focused on developing user interfaces\r\n                        that were intuative for the user. One of the graduate course was a Mobile development course. This was an extremely interesting course where we covered many tools relating to android development.\r\n                        For my final project I developed an app that allowed users to plan out a trip using google maps API. The second course was secure programming and pentration testing. This course focused on how to implement\r\n                        web based attacks such as XSS, SQLi, and cross site request forgery. I enjoyed this class so much that I became the teaching assistant for this course for the next 3 semesters.\r\n      </div>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n                    <div className=\"flex items-center mb-1\">\r\n                        <div className=\"bg-gray-500 rounded-full h-8 w-8\"></div>\r\n                        <div className=\"flex-1 ml-4 font-medium\">January 2019 - Senior Year Spring Semester & Teaching Assistant</div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"ml-12\">\r\n                        This semester I only took 1 graduate course and 3 undergraduate courses. My graduate course was survey of programming languages, this course covered the foundation that programing languages are built on. For the final project\r\n                        I developed a black jack application in python and created a GUI using Tkinter. For my undergraduate courses I took a course on digital image processing. This covered basic functions on digital image processing such as sharpness, monochrome, and resizing.\r\n                        All coursework was done in python. Another course was computer vision, unfortunately this course was taught in MATLAB however, for the final project I developed a program that was able to recognize images of pokemon using KNN.\r\n                        My last undergraduate course was my capstone course where we developed a recipe agrigator website. Users were able to login and search for recipes based on what ingredients they would have in their fridge. The application was developed\r\n                        using Angular and used Firebase as the backend. This concluded my undergraduate journey and now begins my master's degree.\r\n                    <div className=\"p-1\"></div>\r\n                        For my job as a teaching assistant I was responsible for grading assignments, class participation, and exams.

The two most interesting courses were\r\n                            the advanced mobile application course. In advanced mobile app we worked with various mobile technologies such as BLE and text messaging services. However, the most\r\n                            interesting project we worked on was developing our Ride America app. This app allowed users to create chatrooms and request rides from people in the chatroom. A user would send out a request and other users in\r\n                            the chat could respond to the requestor. Then the requestor can see which user is the closest and select that offer. Then the user would be taken to a screen where they can see how far the driver is in real time using\r\n                            google places api. This application was developed for Android.\r\n                            <div className=\"p-1\"></div>\r\n                        During this semster the previous professor teaching pentration testing was taking a semester off. Since the new lecturer had not taught the course before I had to help develop lesson plans and addition to my regular duties.\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li className=\"mb-2\">\r\n                    <div className=\"flex items-center mb-1\">\r\n                        <div className=\"bg-gray-500 rounded-full h-8 w-8\"></div>\r\n                        <div className=\"flex-1 ml-4 font-medium\">January 2020 - Master's Spring Semester & Teaching Assistant</div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"ml-12\">\r\n                        For my last semester the two significant courses I took were intelligent systems and Computer communication and networks. In the intelligent system course \r\n                        I solved the N Queen problem by developing a Hill Climbing search algorithm and I solved the 8-puzzle problem using A* search. For my communication and networks course\r\n                        I developed a chatroom application in java using Sockets. unfortunately the lessons online due to COVID-19 were not as engaging as the in person sessions making it more difficult to learn. \r\n                        However, I was still able to complete my Master's degree.\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n                </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div >)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Home","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nfunction About() {\r\n    return (<div>\r\n        <h1 className=\"font-bold text-2xl mb\">About us</h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n            This is the about page content\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nfunction Projects() {\r\n    return (<div>\r\n        <h1 className=\"font-bold text-2xl mb\">About us</h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n            This is the about page content\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Projects","import React from 'react';\nimport './tailwind.css';\nimport Header from './Components/Header';\nimport Footer from './Components/Footer';\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Switch,\n  Route,\n} from \"react-router-dom\"\nimport Home from './Views/Home';\nimport About from './Views/About';\nimport Projects from './Views/Projects';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"relative pb-10 min-h-screen \">\n      <Router>\n        <Header />\n\n        <Switch>\n          <Route  exact path=\"/resume\">\n            <Home />\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route path=\"/about\">\n            <About />\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route path=\"/projects\">\n            <Projects />\n          </Route>\n        </Switch>\n\n        <Footer />\n      </Router>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
